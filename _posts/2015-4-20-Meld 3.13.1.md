======================
-->

Features
--------

* Previously, Meld could show very different results in file vs. folder
  comparisons when the files differed in line endings. These are now much
  more consistent.
   * In folder comparisons, applying filters now also normalises line
     endings (Kai Willadsen)
   * In a file comparison, if the files-are-identical notification is shown
     when files differ in line endings, this now mentioned (Kai Willadsen)
   * There is a new preferences controlling whether to apply text filters
     during folder comparisons, defaulting to on, which also controls line
     ending normalisation (Kai Willadsen)
   * Help documentation has been updated with details of how text filters
     are applied in folder comparison (Kai Willadsen)
* Folder comparisons will now show an identical notification similar to the
  one used in file comparison (Kai Willadsen)
* The "New blank comparion" button now works for folder comparisons as well
  as file ones (Kai Willadsen)
* In folder comparisons, the expansion state of the tree is now remembered
  when you collapse and re-expand a row (Kai Willadsen)
