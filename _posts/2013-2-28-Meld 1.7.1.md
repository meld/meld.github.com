2013-2-28 meld 1.7.1
====================
-->

Features
--------

* Folder comparisons can now show extra information, such as file size and
  modification times. Column visibility and ordering are properly
  configurable. (Philipp Müller, Kai Willadsen)
* Shallow comparison (i.e., based on size and timestamp) are now supported
  for folder comparisons, including timestamp resolution preferences for
  cross-filesystem comparisons. (Cristian Dinu)
* The UI for launching new comparisons has been reworked to have a clearer
  workflow, and is now shown on startup if no other comparisons have been
  opened (Kai Willadsen)
* Recently-used comparisons are now supported, allowing you to re-open
  previous comparisons directly. (Kai Willadsen)
* Read-only files are now not editable by default, making merge actions
  clearer and more consistent. Individual read-only files can easily be set
  as editable as desired. (Kai Willadsen)

Fixes
-----

* New version control API, currently used by Git and Subversion (Kai
  Willadsen)
* Version control compatibility updates and fixes (Cedric Le Dillau, Louis
  des Landes, Kai Willadsen)
* Command line labelling options now apply to folder tabs (Kai Willadsen)
* Regressions from parallel inline highlighting calculations have been
  fixed (Kai Willadsen)
* Diff algorithm cleanups (Piotr Piastucki)
* Compatibility fixes for Python 3; this does *not* mean that Meld works on
  Python 3 yet, just that 2to3 issues have been addressed (Kai Willadsen)
