    <h2>What is Meld?</h2>
    <p>
    Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld
    helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled
    projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files
    and directories, and has support for many popular version control
    systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even
    help you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.

    <h2>Get it</h2>
    <p>
    Meld is packaged for just about every Linux and Unix distribution,
    including Fedora, Ubuntu, and Suse. You should get Meld from your
    distribution's installer unless you want the absolute latest version.
    </p>

    <p>
    The current release of Meld is 1.5.2. If you'd like to try out the
    latest and best,
    <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/meld/1.5/meld-1.5.2.tar.bz2">download the archive</a>,
    extract it and run the <code>meld</code> file in the <code>bin</code>
    folder.
    </p>

    <p>
    While Meld does work on OS X and Windows, there are no all-in-one packages
    for those systems available at the moment. On OS X, Meld is available from
    MacPorts or Fink. There are some notes available on
    <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Meld/Windows">how to get Meld running on
    Windows.</a>
