When comparing several files, you may have sections of text where differences
aren't really important. For example, you may want to focus on changed sections
of code, and ignore any changes in comment lines. With text filters you can
tell <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span> to ignore text that matches a pattern (i.e., a regular
expression) when showing differences between files.

  Text filters don't just affect file comparisons, but also folder comparisons.

  details.

You can turn text filters on or off from the the <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" gui">Text Filters</span> tab in
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" gui">Preferences</span> dialog. <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span> comes with a few simple filters
that you might find useful, but you can add your own as well.
</p>
<p class="p">
In <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span>, text filters are regular expressions that are matched
against the text of files you're comparing. Any text that is matched is ignored
during the comparsion; you'll still see this text in the comparison view, but
it won't be taken into account when finding differences. Text filters are
applied in order, so it's possible for the first filter to remove text that now
makes the second filter match, and so on.

  If you're not familiar with regular expressions, you might want to check out

<div class="contents">
<p class="p first-child">
It's easy to get text filtering wrong, and Meld's support for filtering isn't
complete. In particular, a text filter can't change the number of lines in a
file. For example, if we had the built-in <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" gui">Script comment</span> filter
enabled, and compared the following files:
</p>
<div class="table"><table class="table"><tbody><tr>
<td>
<div class="listing first-child">
<div class="title title-listing"><span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" file">comment1.txt</span></div>
<div class="listing-contents"><pre class="code first-child">a
b#comment
c
d</pre></div>
</div>
</td>
<td>
<div class="listing first-child">
<div class="title title-listing"><span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" file">comment2.txt</span></div>
<div class="listing-contents"><pre class="code first-child">a
b
c
#comment</pre></div>
</div>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>
<p class="p">
then the lines starting with <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" code">b</span> would be shown as identical (the
comment is stripped out) but the <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" code">d</span> line would be shown as
different to the comment line on the right. This happens because the
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" code">#comment</span> is removed from the right-hand side, but the line itself
can not be removed; <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span> will show the <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" code">d</span> line as being
different to what it sees as a blank line on the other side.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="text-filter-blank-lines">
<div class="header"><h2 class="title">Blank lines and filters</h2></div>
<div class="contents">
<p class="p first-child">
The <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" gui">Ignore changes which insert or delete blank lines</span> preference
in the <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" gui">Text Filters</span> tab requires special explanation. If this
special filter is enabled, then any change consisting only of blank lines is
completely ignored. This may occur because there was an actual whitespace
change in the text, but it may also arise if your active text filters have
removed all of the other content from a change, leaving only blank lines.
</p>
<p class="p">
You can use this option to get around some of the
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" link"><a href="#text-filter-problems" title="">problems and limitations</a></span> resulting
from filters not being able to remove whole lines, but it can also be useful
in and of itself.
