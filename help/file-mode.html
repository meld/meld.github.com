<span class=" app" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/">Meld</span> lets you compare two or three text files side-by-side. You can
start a new file comparison by selecting the
<span class=" guiseq" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/"><span class=" gui">File</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">New...</span></span>
menu item.
</p>
<p class="p">
Once you've selected your files, <span class=" app" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/">Meld</span> will show them side-by-side.
Differences between the files will be highlighted to make individual changes
easier to see. Editing the files will cause the comparison to update
on-the-fly. For details on navigating between individual changes, and on
how to use change-based editing, see <span class=" link" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/"><a href="file-changes.html" title="">Dealing with changes</a></span>.

<span class=" app" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/">Meld</span>'s file comparisons</h2></div>
<div class="contents">
<p class="p first-child">
There are several different parts to a file comparison. The most important
parts are the editors where your files appear. In addition to these editors,
the areas around and between your files give you a visual overview and actions
to help you handle changes between the files.
</p>
<p class="p">
On the left and right-hand sides of the window, there are two small vertical
bars showing various coloured blocks. These bars are designed to give you an
overview of all of the differences between your two files. Each coloured block
represents a section that is inserted, deleted, changed or in conflict between
your files, depending on the block's colour used.
</p>
<p class="p">
In between each pair of files is a segment that shows how the changed sections
between your files correspond to each other. You can click on the arrows in a
segment to replace sections in one file with sections from the other. You can
also delete, copy or merge changes. For details on what you can do with
individual change segments, see <span class=" link" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/"><a href="file-changes.html#change-actions" title="">Changing changes</a></span>.

Once you've finished editing your files, you need to save each file you've
changed.
</p>
<p class="p">
You can tell whether your files have been saved since they last changed by
the save icon that appears next to the file name above each file. Also, the
notebook label will show an asterisk (<span class=" code" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/">*</span>) after any file that
hasn't been saved.
</p>
<p class="p">
You can save the current file by selecting the
<span class=" guiseq" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/"><span class=" gui">File</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Save</span></span>
menu item, or using the <span class=" keyseq" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/"><span class=" key">Ctrl</span>+<span class=" key">S</span></span> keyboard
shortcut.
</p>
<div class="note"><div class="note-inner"><div class="note-contents"><p class="p first-child">
    Saving only saves the <span class=" em" xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/">currently focussed</span> file, which is the file
    containing the cursor. If you can't tell which file is focussed, you can
    click on the file to focus it before saving.
