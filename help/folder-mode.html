<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span> lets you compare two or three folders side-by-side. You can
start a new folder comparison by selecting the
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">File</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">New...</span></span>
menu item, and clicking on the <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" gui">Directory Comparison</span>
tab.
</p>
<p class="p">
Your selected folders will be shown as side-by-side trees, with
differences between files in each folder highlighted. You can copy
or delete files from either folder, or compare individual text files
in more detail.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="">
<div class="header"><h2 class="title">The folder comparison view</h2></div>
<div class="contents">
<p class="p first-child">
The main parts of a folder comparison are the trees showing the folders
you're comparing. You can easily <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" link"><a href="#folder-navigation" title="">move
around</a></span> these comparisons to find changes that you're interested
in. When you select a file or folder, more detailed information is
given in the status bar at the bottom of the window. Pressing
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" key">Enter</span> on a selected file, or double-clicking any file in the
tree will open a side-by-side <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" link"><a href="file-mode.html" title="">file
comparison</a></span> of the files in a new tab, but this will only work
properly if they're text files!
</p>
<p class="p">
There are bars on the left and right-hand sides of the window that show
you a simple coloured summary of the comparison results. Each file or
folder in the comparison corresponds to a small section of these bars,
though <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span> doesn't show <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" em">Same</span> files so that it's
easier to see any actually important differences. You can click anywhere
on this bar to jump straight to that place in the comparison.

<p class="p first-child">
You can jump between changed files (that is, any files/folders that
are <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" em">not</span> classified as being identical) with the
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">Changes</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Previous change</span></span>
and
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">Changes</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Next change</span></span>
menu items, or using the corresponding buttons on the toolbar.
</p>
<p class="p">
You can use the <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" key">Left</span> and <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" key">Right</span> arrow keys to move
between the folders you're comparing. This is useful so that you can
select an individual file for copying or deletion.

Each file or folder in a tree has its own <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" em">state</span>, telling you
how it differed from its corresponding files/folders. The possible
states are:

        When comparing this file, an error occurred. The most common
        error causes are file permissions (i.e., <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" app">Meld</span> was not
        allowed to open the file) and filename encoding errors.
        </p>

You can filter out files based on these states, for example, to show only
files that have are <span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" em">Modified</span>. You can read more about this in
<span xmlns:e="http://projectmallard.org/experimental/" class=" link"><a href="file-filters.html#file-state-filter" title="">File differences filtering</a></span>.

Finally, the most recently modified file/folder has an emblem
attached to it.
