    <h2>Trying out the current version</h2>
    <p>
    One of Meld's lesser-known features is that it's easy to run without
    installing it. This is great for just trying out the current version, or
    for checking to see whether your pet bug has been fixed yet. Just get a
    copy of the source code from Git by opening a terminal and typing:
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>git clone https://git.gnome.org/browse/meld</code>
    </p>
    <p>
    From the directory you cloned into, run:
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>bin/meld</code>
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting bugs</h2>
    <p>
    If you find a problem, please <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=meld">report a bug</a> at GNOME's bugzilla.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please, first check to see whether your bug still exists in the current
    version and see whether someone else has
    <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?query=product%3Ameld">reported the bug already</a>.

    <h2>Getting Meld's source code</h2>
    <p>
    The Meld source code is kept at the GNOME Git repository. You can easily
    browse the current version of the source code at:<br/>
    <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/meld/">http://git.gnome.org/browse/meld/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you'd like to contribute, then grab a copy of the code, make some
    changes, and submit a patch to the mailing list or bugzilla.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting involved</h2>
    <p>
    If you're interested in participating in Meld's development, or if you're
    just a generally curious person, you can subscribe to Meld's
    <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/meld-list">mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can also ask questions, propose ideas and get help on the mailing list.
    It's a fairly quiet place though, so don't be surprised if it takes a while
    to get an answer.

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
    Meld doesn't have an official roadmap as such. At least not one that's
    actually followed. Here are a list of things that are on the radar for the
    near future:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Modernise the 'build' system</li>
        <li>Move to using gtkrc-defined colours everywhere</li>
        <li>Improve our comparison performance by adding a Cython version of
            MyersMatcher</li>
        <li>Add a limited D-Bus interface to support opening new comparisons
            in tabs</li>
    </ul>
